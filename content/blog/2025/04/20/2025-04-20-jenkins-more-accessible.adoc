Jenkins now fully supports increased contrast settings, offering a more accessible user interface experience. With this
update, users will notice sharper borders and clearer visual differentiation between interface elements, making Jenkins
more user-friendly for all, particularly those with visual impairments.

According to the World Health Organization, approximately 15% of the global population lives with some form of
disability, with an estimated 4.5% experiencing moderate to severe vision impairment. Enhancements like increased
contrast play a crucial role in ensuring digital tools like Jenkins are usable by everyone.

This feature and more are now available as part of the latest Jenkins release.
