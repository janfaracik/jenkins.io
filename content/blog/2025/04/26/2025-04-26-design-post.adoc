Jenkins is the most used CI/CD platform in the world. It's one of the oldest, most mature systems in
continuous integration and delivery, and it powers software pipelines across critical industries like finance,
healthcare, and government.
With over a million lines of code, more than 2,000 plugins, and millions of users,
Jenkins is less a "tool" and more of a global infrastructure backbone.

And because of all that - making changes is hard. Really hard.

== Part Two - The Problem



=== What's next

In Part Three, we'll dive deeper into the design decisions behind some of the new UI features, how we're improving the
developer experience, and what we're doing to ensure compatibility across the plugin ecosystem without slowing
down progress.
