Jenkins is the most used CI/CD platform in the world. It's one of the oldest, most mature systems in
continuous integration and delivery, and it powers software pipelines across critical industries like finance,
healthcare, and government. With over a million lines of code, more than 2,000 plugins, and 11+ million users,
Jenkins is less a "tool" and more of a global infrastructure backbone.

And because of all that - making changes is hard. Really hard.

== Part One - The Problem

The web has evolved significantly since Jenkins' inception - and as a result of that we've been carrying a lot of
legacy technology along the way.

We've had http://prototypejs.org[Prototype.js], https://yui.github.io/yui2/[YUI 2], https://lesscss.org[LESS],
fragments of https://jquery.com[early jQuery], and a patchwork of UI components from different eras of frontend
development. The result? A frontend stack that's tough to maintain, painful to extend, and a real barrier for
contributors.

That's not a knock on Jenkins - it's just the reality of any large, long-lived platform. Over time, the
ground shifts beneath you. What was best practice in 2005 becomes technical debt in 2025.

So, we knew something had to change.

=== Maintaining compatibility

In modernizing the Jenkins frontend, one of our foremost priorities has been to preserve backward compatibility,
maintain platform stability, and ensure that no production pipelines are disrupted as a result of UI or
framework changes. Given Jenkins' role in powering mission-critical CI/CD workflows across global
enterprises, even small regressions can have far-reaching impact.

To achieve this, our approach has been pragmatic, cautious, and highly incremental. Rather than introducing
disruptive overhauls, we have focused on gradually modernizing the codebase over a period of several years,
ensuring each change is thoroughly tested and validated in real-world use cases.

All enhancements are subject to comprehensive automated testing, including compatibility checks against
Jenkins' vast plugin ecosystem. In addition, our weekly release cycle provides early visibility into changes
and allows us to gather feedback from a broad subset of users before changes are widely adopted. This incremental
and community-focused development strategy has allowed us to modernize Jenkins' interface and architecture while
upholding the reliability that millions of developers depend on.

=== Resetting the foundations

We've deliberately avoided complex frameworks and heavyweight dependencies. Modern JavaScript - just plain, native JS -
is more than capable these days. With ES modules, native fetch, template literals, arrow functions, and all the
niceties of modern ECMAScript, we can write expressive, maintainable code without bringing in React, Angular, or Vue.

That doesn't mean we're afraid of modern tooling - just that we're selective. The goal is to lower the barrier to
entry for contributors, not raise it. Jenkins has hundreds of contributors around the world contributing in all
kinds of ways - we don't want our frontend stack to be a gatekeeper.

Here's what we've tackled as part of Phase One:

- Removed Prototype.js - finally laid this one to rest. It's been a major blocker to adopting modern JS syntax,
and removing it has unlocked a lot of long-awaited changes.

- Removed YUI - this one was massive. YUI was baked deep into many areas of the Jenkins UI, and cleaning it out
has drastically simplified our asset tree.

- Migrated from LESS to SCSS - small but meaningful. SCSS is better supported and more modern. This has made
it easier to structure styles, enforce consistency, and work with tooling like linters.

- Standardized the use of modern JavaScript - ES6+ syntax, modularized code, and better use of browser-native APIs.
We're slowly replacing inline scripts and global functions with structured, maintainable modules.

Every one of these changes helps reduce complexity, improve maintainability, and pave the way for more ambitious
UI improvements.

Some of these changes might seem small from the outside, but collectively they've laid a new foundation for
Jenkins. This is the groundwork that makes future UX improvements possible - things like cleaner plugin integration,
improved accessibility, better navigation, and modern UI components.

=== What's next

In Part Two, we'll dive deeper into the design decisions behind some of the new UI features, how we're improving the
developer experience, and what we're doing to ensure compatibility across the plugin ecosystem without slowing down
innovation.
